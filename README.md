# Welcome!

## Goals
Sharing and collecting knowledge and experience regarding:
-- CQRS(Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
-- ES(Event Sourcing)

We strive to accomplish above goals through trial and error projects and
meetings.

## Contributing
Be as open and descriptive as possible in all material(code, talks, documents,
etc.).

## Overall domain
We will base our talks and examples based upon the business surrounding a
lemonade stand. We will explore the domain using event storming.
